## Install and load the the `stringr` package, which has a variety of built in functions that make working
## with string variables easier.  You may read more about stringr in Wickham & Grolemund "R for Data Science"
## http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html



## Create a numeric variable `my_age` that is equal to your age



## Create a variable `my_name` that is equal to your first name




### -------------------- Working with functions --------------------

## Write a function called `make_introduction` that takes in two arguments: name, and age. 
## This function should return a string value that says something like "Hello, my name is {name}, and I'm
## {age} years old".



## Create a variable `my_intro` by passing your variables `my_name` and `my_age` into your `make_introduction`
## function



## Create a variable `casual_intro` by substituting "Hello, my name is ", with "Hey, I'm" in your `my_intro`
## variable



## Create a new variable `loud_intro`, which is your `my_intro` variable in all upper-case letters



## Create a new variable `quiet_intro`, which is your `my_intro` variable in all lower-case letters



## Create a new variable capitalized, which is your `my_intro` variable with each word capitalized 
## hint: consult the stringr function `str_to_title`



## Using the `str_count` function, create a variable `occurrences` that stores the # of times the letter "e"
## appears in `my_intro`



## Write another function `double` that takes in a (numeric) variable and returns that variable times two



## Using your `double` function, create a variable `minutes_in_two_days`, which is the number of minutes in
## two days



## Write another function `third_power` that takes in a value and returns that value cubed



## Create a variable `twenty_seven`` by passing the number 3 to your `cube` function
