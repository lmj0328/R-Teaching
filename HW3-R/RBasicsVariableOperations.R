## Install and load the the `stringr` package, which has a variety of built in functions that make working
## with string variables easier.  You may read more about stringr in Wickham & Grolemund "R for Data Science"
## http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html



## Create a numeric variable `my_age` that is equal to your age



## Create a variable `my_name` that is equal to your first name



## Using multiplication, create a variable `minutes_in_day` that is equal to the number of minutes in a day



## Using multiplication, create a variable `hours_in_year` that is the number of hours in a year




## Create a variable `minutes_rule` that is a boolean value (TRUE/FALSE) by logical operations
## It should be TRUE if there are more minutes in a day than hours in a year, otherwise FALSE



## Compute and print the following a bit useful numbers.
## Assign the results to suitably named variables.
## 
## How many seconds are there in year?



## How many seconds is a typical human lifetime?



## Age of the universe is 13.8 billion years.  What is it's age in seconds?
## Comment:
## If you estimate, based on timings on a small dataset, that your task on the full data
## takes more than this many seconds on a fast computers,
## we can safely say that your code fails :-)
